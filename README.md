# Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) Tutorial using Qiskit

In this tutorial, we'll explore how to model and solve a simplified version of the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) as a Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) problem using Qiskit. TSP is a classic logistics problem where a salesman needs to visit each city exactly once and return to the starting city while minimizing the total travel distance.

## Formulating the Traveling Salesman Problem as a QUBO

### Problem Definition:
- We have \( n \) cities and the distance between each pair of cities is known.
- The goal is to find the shortest possible route that visits each city exactly once and returns to the origin city.

### QUBO Formulation:
- We'll represent the problem using binary variables $` x_{i,j} ` where \( x_{i,j} = 1 \) if the salesman travels from city \( i \) to city \( j \), and \( x_{i,j} = 0 \) otherwise.
- The objective is to minimize the total distance traveled, which can be written as:
\[ \text{Minimize } \sum_{i,j} d_{i,j} \cdot x_{i,j} \]
where \( d_{i,j} \) is the distance between city \( i \) and city \( j \).

### Constraints:
- Each city should be visited exactly once:
\[ \sum_{i} x_{i,j} = 1, \quad \sum_{j} x_{i,j} = 1, \quad \forall i, j \]
- Subtour elimination (to ensure the salesman doesnâ€™t visit a subset of cities and return to the starting point, ignoring other cities): A common way is to introduce auxiliary variables and additional constraints to the QUBO formulation.

### Combining Objective and Constraints:
- We can combine the objective function and constraints into a single QUBO expression by introducing penalty terms for violating the constraints:
\[ \text{Minimize } \sum_{i,j} d_{i,j} \cdot x_{i,j} + P \cdot \left( \sum_{i} x_{i,j} - 1 \right)^2 + P \cdot \left( \sum_{j} x_{i,j} - 1 \right)^2 + \ldots \]
where \( P \) is a sufficiently large penalty term.

### Encoding the QUBO into a Matrix:
- Finally, we need to encode the QUBO formulation into a matrix format which can be input into Qiskit for solving. This involves creating a matrix \( Q \) where each element \( Q_{ij} \) corresponds to the quadratic coefficients of the binary variables \( x_{i,j} \).

## Implementing and Solving the QUBO using Qiskit

```python
# Import necessary libraries
from qiskit_optimization import QuadraticProgram
from qiskit_optimization.algorithms import MinimumEigenOptimizer
from qiskit import Aer
from qiskit.algorithms import QAOA
from qiskit.utils import algorithm_globals, QuantumInstance

# Define the distances between cities (assuming 3 cities for simplicity)
distance_matrix = [[0, 2, 9], [1, 0, 6], [10, 7, 0]]

# Create a Quadratic Program for TSP
tsp_qubo = QuadraticProgram(name='TSP')

# Add binary variables for each edge between cities
n = len(distance_matrix)
for i in range(n):
    for j in range(n):
        tsp_qubo.binary_var(name=f'x{i}{j}')

# Define the objective function
objective = tsp_qubo.objective
for i in range(n):
    for j in range(n):
        objective.linear[f'x{i}{j}'] = distance_matrix[i][j]

# Add constraints to ensure each city is visited exactly once
for i in range(n):
    tsp_qubo.linear_constraint(
        linear={f'x{i}{j}': 1 for j in range(n)}, sense='E', rhs=1, name=f'visit_city{i}_once'
    )
    tsp_qubo.linear_constraint(
        linear={f'x{j}{i}': 1 for j in range(n)}, sense='E', rhs=1, name=f'leave_city{i}_once'
    )

# Solve the QUBO using QAOA
algorithm_globals.random_seed = 12345  # Set random seed for reproducibility
qi = QuantumInstance(Aer.get_backend('aer_simulator_statevector'), seed_simulator=12345, seed_transpiler=12345)
qaoa = QAOA(quantum_instance=qi)
optimizer = MinimumEigenOptimizer(qaoa)
result = optimizer.solve(tsp_qubo)

# Print the results
print(result)

# The optimal solution can be extracted from the results
x = result.x
optimal_route = [(i, j) for i in range(n) for j in range(n) if x[n*i + j] == 1]
print(f'Optimal route: {optimal_route}')
